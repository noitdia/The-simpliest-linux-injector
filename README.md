The Simplest Linux Injector

Warning: This repository is for educational purposes only. Do not use this injector for any illegal activities. Use at your own risk.

This is a basic Linux injector that I didn't have the time to fully develop (Couldnt bash my head against the wall enough). As a result, it only supports one injection method and one operating system. I'm releasing it in the hopes that someone else might try to fix the code for me.

Current Features:

    One injection method LD_PRELOAD
    Support for one operating system Linux (Well technically it works on Windows too, but theres no windows injection method so why even run it on windows)

Known Limitations:

    Only tested on Arch Linux
    May not work as intended (or at all)

Future Development:

If you're interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to fork and modify the code. (Fix the code for me KEKW)

Disclaimer:

Again, please do not use this injector for any illegal activities. I am not responsible for any damage or consequences resulting from its use.
